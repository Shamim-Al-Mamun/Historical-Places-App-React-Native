Stretching over 13,000 miles across northern China, this monumental structure was built over several dynasties, primarily to protect Chinese states from invading nomadic tribes. Construction began as early as the 7th century BCE, but most of the existing wall was built during the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644). The wall is not a single continuous line but a series of walls, watchtowers, and fortifications interlinked to form a defensive barrier. The Great Wall traverses deserts, mountains, and plains, showcasing the ingenuity and resilience of ancient Chinese engineering. Beyond its military purpose, the wall also facilitated trade, communication, and cultural exchange along its route, playing a critical role in the development of Chinese civilization. Today, it stands as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a global tourist attraction, drawing millions of visitors every year who walk its ancient pathways, climb its watchtowers, and admire breathtaking views of the surrounding landscapes.
